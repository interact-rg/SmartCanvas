# Web-service principle

The webservice allows the core application to be hosted in cloud improving stability and providing functionalities such as image download. Instructions for hosting the application can be found in web_app_installation.md.

Idea of the webservice is to wrap the core implementation so that usage of it is possible on any computer without the need of installing required python dependancies. Important to note is that the current implementation does not encrpyt the image feed in any way and thus you should be midful of what is visible on the camera.
